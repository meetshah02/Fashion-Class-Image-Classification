**Project Structure**
Main.ipynb file contains all the main code for this project which is in both ipynb and pdf file. Open that if you want to read my work.

There is .pptx file which contains Project Presentation.

You will also find two separate data files containing train & test data. Both of them are labelled as 'fashion-mnist_train.csv' & 'fashion-mnist_test.csv' respectively.

As you can see, unlike my some projects, there is no REPORT in this one. The reason is that this is a business problem and not a case study.
Here I classified images for a business need and not a study/problem.

Finally there is a README file which you are reading right now.ðŸ“–
